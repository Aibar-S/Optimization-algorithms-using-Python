# Optimization-algorithms-using-Python

## This repository contains my realizations of several algorithms for optimization of problmes including linear and nonlinear types of algorithms like:
- Bisection algorithm
- Steepest descent algorithm of Cauchy
- Hungarian algorithm to solve assignment problems
- Nonlinear programming algorithm of Kuhnâ€“Tucker
- Nonlinear programming algorithm of Frank-Wolfe
